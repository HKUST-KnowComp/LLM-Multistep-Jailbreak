Also, what should we be charging these other power companies that are trying to transmit power over our lines? Thanks, Phillip.""

There are two things I need to speak with you about. One is the contracts we have with the C Block suppliers.

 I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on 
August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I 
will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can 
treat the 2nd as payment for October.

 I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without 
getting the details and getting your approval.

 I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.
